# How to specify several working time intervals for different days of week


<p>This example illustrates how the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebASPxSchedulerASPxScheduler_QueryWorkTimetopic">QueryWorkTime</a> event can be used to set up working time intervals for different days of week. <br />
The <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraSchedulerQueryWorkTimeEventArgs_WorkTimetopic">WorkTime</a> property of the event arguments provides access to the collection of work time intervals for a particular day. This collection can be modified as required.</p>
